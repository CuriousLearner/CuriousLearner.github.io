      <div class="center-align">Hi, I'm <strong>Sanyam Khurana</strong>, also known as <strong>CuriousLearner</strong>.</div><br>

      <p>I'm a <strong>Principal Engineer</strong> and <strong>AWS Certified Solutions Architect</strong> with over 10 years of experience building scalable, cloud-native backend systems. I specialize in architecting high-performance infrastructure using Python, Django, Golang, AWS, and modern DevOps practices.</p>

      <p>I hold a <strong>Master of Science in Computer Science</strong> with specialization in Machine Learning and Interactive Intelligence from <strong>Georgia Institute of Technology</strong>. My journey as a "community-taught" programmer instilled in me a deep appreciation for knowledge sharing and continuous learning.</p>

      <p>I'm passionate about <strong>Open Source</strong>. I've contributed to <strong>CPython</strong>, <strong>Django</strong>, <strong>Django REST Framework</strong>, and <strong>Mozilla</strong> projects. Ever typed <code>print "hello"</code> in Python 3 and got a helpful syntax error suggesting <code>print("hello")</code>? That's one of my contributions to CPython—making Python's error messages more user-friendly! I was granted bug-triaging access on <a href="https://bugs.python.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">bugs.python.org</a> and I'm featured on <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/credits/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mozilla Credits</a>.</p>

      <p>Beyond coding, I'm committed to giving back to the community. I was a <strong>Google Summer of Code Mentor at Debian</strong>, speak at international conferences (DjangoCon US, PyCon AU), and mentor developers worldwide. I'm a <strong>vouched Mozillian</strong> and an active contributor to the Python and Django communities.</p>

          <p><strong>Community Over Competition:</strong> Surround yourself with talented, passionate people. The best engineers I know didn't learn in isolation—they learned by collaborating, pair programming, and building alongside others who challenged them to grow.</p><br>
          <p><strong>Teaching Amplifies Learning:</strong> The fastest way to truly master a concept is to teach it to someone else. When you explain your code, your architecture decisions, or debug someone else's problem, you deepen your own understanding exponentially.</p><br>
          <p><strong>Read Code, Don't Just Write It:</strong> Want to become a better engineer? Read open source code. Study how Django handles middleware, how CPython implements generators, how successful projects structure their architecture. Reading quality code is like learning from the best mentors in the world.</p><br>
          <p><strong>Curiosity is Your Superpower:</strong> No bootcamp, course, or mentor can teach you more than your own genuine curiosity. Ask "why" relentlessly. Dig into the source when something doesn't make sense. The most valuable skill isn't knowing the answer—it's knowing how to find it.</p><br>
          <p><strong>Build to Learn, Not Just to Ship:</strong> Every project is an opportunity to level up. Don't just copy-paste solutions—understand them. Experiment with different approaches. Break things in staging. The lessons from failures often teach more than successes.</p><br>
