          <p>Surround yourself with good people; they are the best source of inspiration and knowledge. I learn a lot spending my time with such people.</p><br>

          <p>Learning is a two-way process; if we learn something, we should always teach others, it helps in improving our own skills.</p><br>

          <p>Read more source code. That is the fastest method to learn.</p><br>

          <p>No one can teach you more than your own willingness to learn! 'Curiousity' to 'Learn' is the biggest teacher.</p><br>
